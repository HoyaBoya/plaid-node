# Plaid Node (Up&Up Fork)

This branch will never be accepted by Plaid.

## About

Plaid moved their JS library to OpenAPI, which auto-generates the JS code based on an API schema.

We have no way of opening a PR or contributing to this schema. As such, we make direct changes to api.js.

DO NOT: Run the open api generator
DO NOT: Convert the Typescript files to Javascript
